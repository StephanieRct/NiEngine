NiEngine is an event-based system of actions and reactions between game objects. It lets users author “Reactions” on any GameObject through a “Reaction” or “ReactionStateMachine” component. These authored reactions will trigger, according to certain conditions, a list of actions such as enabling/disabling game objects, calling a C# function, set Transform values,  or triggering other reactions on other GameObjects.

NiEngine has its own save system that can save and load any components or custom data.
